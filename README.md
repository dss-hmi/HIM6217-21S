# Data

Homework rely on synthetic data bases inspired by the [Medicare Claims Synthetic Public Use Files (SynPUFs)](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs). For the scripts generating and augmenting these synthetic data bases see [./manipulation/](./manipulation) folder.
